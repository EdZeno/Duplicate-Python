# Duplicate Encoder

This a simple code cate to practice Python and pytest.

## What does it do?

Convert a string to a new string where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string, or ")" if that character appears more than once in the original string. Ignore capitalization when determining if a character is a duplicate.

## PS

It is a very basic code kata just to get fluent in typing Python syntax.
